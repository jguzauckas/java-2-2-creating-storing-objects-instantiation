# Understanding Check

In the `Understanding.java` file, you are going to create a grade average calculator. Your program should have the following:

- 3 different whole number variables that hold onto a grade.
- 1 decimal variable that stores the average grade (calculated as a decimal, not a whole number)
- Print out each of the 3 grades, then print out the average of those grades.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
