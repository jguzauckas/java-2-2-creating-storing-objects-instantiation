# Understanding Check

Note that for this portion of the assignment, the `Person.java` file has seen some changes.

In `Understanding.java`, for each of the following requirements, create a variable and assign it a new object that meets the requirements:

- A basic Person
- A Person that is 21 years old
- A Person that is 12 years old, is 43.5 inches tall, and was born in 2011
- A Person that is 17 years old and is 64 inches tall
- A Person that is 35 years old, is not a student, is 59.25 inches tall, and was born in 1988
- A Person that is not a student, and is 50 inches tall

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
