# You Do

Note that for this portion of the assignment, the `Person.java` file has seen some changes.

In `Do.java`, for each of the following requirements, create a variable and assign it a new object that meets the requirements:

- A basic Person
- A Person that is 20 years old
- A Person that is 16 years old and is 61.5 inches tall
- A Person that is a student, and is 52.5 inches tall
- A Person that is 10 years old, is 47 inches tall, and was born in 2012
- A Person that is 30 years old, is not a student, is 59 inches tall, and was born in 1993

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
