# You Do

In the `Do.java` file, accomplish the following:

- Declare a decimal variable called `variable1`.
- Assign the number `10` as a decimal to `variable1`.
- Add `2.5` to the value of `variable1` and save the result to `variable1`.
- Initialize a whole number variable called `variable2` with the value of `3` times `variable1`.
- Initialize a whole number variable called `variable3` with the value of `variable1` divided by 3.
- Initialize a decimal variable called `variable4` with the value of `variable2` divided by `variable3`, but done as double division, not integer division.
- Create a double variable called `age` and assign your current age as an estimated double (take the number of months since your birthday and divide by 12 for the decimal portion).
- Print out your age stored in the variable `age` as an integer, rounding the way we typically would for ages (rounding down).

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
