# Initial Try

Can you fix each of the lines in the `Try.java` file to correctly assign a `Person` variable to a person object?

Can you modify the `person4` assignment to give the `Person` an age of 16?

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
